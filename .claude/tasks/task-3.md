# Task-3 - Footer for portfolio

Your task is to implement footer for my project portfolio using <ContactBlock/> on the home page. It is important that we can adapt this block to the About page and the Home page. It is necessary to draw the main communication methods there, as well as links to contact me, namely:
1. **Telegram**: @zverina1337
2. **E-mail**: danii.zvorugin@gmail.com
3. **hh.ru**: Link to the resume on - https://tomsk.hh.ru/resume/eed62117ff0ba6ae0e0039ed1f36704c687551
4. **GitHub**: https://github.com/Zverina1337

It is also important that the block also has its own style and adds a wow effect at the site-wide level. 

## Key Features
1. **The letters CONTACT in the background of the block**: Make them 3D so that the user can move them sideways when hovering.
2. **Button in the middle of the block with CONTACT ME**: Make it just move closer to the user's cursor, but it is important that it is not sharp, but smooth, so that the button does not spin in place, so that the block itself is smoothly attracted to the cursor, as if by a magnet.
3. **Links should lead to the available pages of the service (/, /about, /projects).**: Leave them as they look now.
4. **Dimensions**: Make the block fit to the bottom of the page, it is important that it has a size of 85vh.
5. **Observer**: Be sure to add animations as the user's viewport approaches the block.

## Steps
1. **Implement a 3D model of all the buttons in the background of the block**
2. ** Make an animation on the letters **: as if when you hover the cursor, they move away, as if the letters are a crowd of people, and I (the cursor) am trying to squeeze through them and pass on.
3. **Redo the physics of the magnetism of the central button**: it should smoothly follow the cursor in its area in the middle.
4. **Add links from the bottom as before**: Just place 3 links to /, /about/ /projects through the separator.
5. **Register the above links from below**: Here you need to implement a UX/UI element of the page that is pleasant to the eye, show your creativity here.
